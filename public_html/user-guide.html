       <h2>User Guide</h2>
       <h3>What is SoMa ?</h3>
       <p><a href="index.html">SoMa</a> is a web application which searches for your keywords through various social networks in order to do a social mashup.<br/><br/>
       Search are results are fetched from sites like <a href="http://wwww.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://plus.google.com">Google Plus</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a>
            and <a href="http://wwww.flickr.com">Flickr</a> by using their REST APIs which gives
           SoMa the latest items related to the search keywords the user enters.
       </p>
       <h3>How to use Soma ?</h3>
       <p>
       SoMa is a free application and can be used by anyone who reaches it.<br/><br/>

       Search action can be performed without being need for the user to register, but for more complex results the application offers the possibility
       to sign in with Twitter in order for the search results to include the latest tweets about the subject the user is searching.<br/><br/>

       The interface is user - friendly and very intuitive. Everyone who uses internet is familiar with search engines. SoMa works exactly the same. All
       the user has to do is to reach the first page, use the front search box to enter the keywords and then just press the mashup button in order for the
       results to be displayed. After hitting the search button, the application will redirect the user to another page where the social mashup will be done, and the
       results will be displayed by categories which can be navigated by using the tab menu located just under the search box which will be located on the top now.<br/>

       Search results cand be viewed in four different modes. The default one is the <i>Mashup</i> mode which can be accesed by going to the <i>Mashup</i> tab. Here the
       user can view four different columns which contain results of all types: <i>Stories, Images, Videos</i>. If the user wants to see just one type
       of results, he has the possibility to do it by navigating trough the other tabs Stories, Images or Videos and changing the mood the results are displayed. <br/><br/>

           Geo-Localisation
           is also available by using <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> services. If user's search query contains keywords about a location or a place, the <i>Map</i> placed on the <i>Location</i> section which
           can be viewd on each tab in the right-side will modify according to them.
